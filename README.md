## Introduction

emo is a Firefox extension that provides an judgment on each webpage and returns a lively emoji as feedback. It allows users to "preview" the emotion in the website, so they can better decide whether they want to browse it or not and better manage their own emotions.

## Technical Details

emo uses Javascript to interact with Firefox, and it uses Python to analyze the contents of a webpage with native messaging.

## Setup

emo is currently limited to developer edition.
